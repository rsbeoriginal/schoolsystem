				  	<h3>Principal's Message</h3>
					    <p class="desc1">'Put Passion, Zeal and Enthusiasm into everything you do' - a reality that strikes us time and again, each time a task is taken up at hand. With dynamic changes in the contemporary world, we need to prove our mettle by presence and performance.
					    <br>
It is the reciprocation between the teacher and the taught that makes a building a school. School life - a reservoir of talent and fervor is a prized possession that a child loves to treasure throughout. A DPSite learns over the years in school, that in-spite of surface tension, one must strive to remain at the top. We sincerely believe that the rungs of a ladder are meant to help one foot go higher gradually - this determines the vision of long term success, which is the outcome of 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.
Our results ultimately shine more than our efforts - they project our attitude that throbs in a healthy ambience. Satisfaction can be earned only when obstacles are overcome.
						<br>
Each new day is a new challenge. Find new tactics, methods and modi operandi that are right for today's situation. Hope springs eternal in the human breast - so let's hope for brighter days ahead.
						<br>
It is my conviction that at DPS, NTPC - Farakka, we not only impart text book knowledge but endeavour to ensure and encourage the inquisitiveness in every young mind. The essence of this institution is to prepare the students for their life so that they take up the challenges and ultimately emerge as winners.
